# Examples

## [Menu Fixed on Scroll](http://codeparkhouston.github.io/examples/menu-on-scroll/)

We only need JavaScript to do this because we have something on top of the menu.  If the menu were already at the top, like in Facebook, we would not need to use JavaScript.  We could just used the CSS for `.fixed` on the `.menu`.  See [here](http://codeparkhouston.github.io/examples/menu-on-scroll/about.html).

## [Menu Items and Padding](http://codeparkhouston.github.io/examples/menu-items/)

How we style links within menus matter for the user.  This is an example showing different menus.
